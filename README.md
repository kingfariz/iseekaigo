## About the Project

Iseekaigo is not just a hackathon project; itâ€™s a real-world initiative. We are actively seeking grants, investments, and partnerships to bring Iseekaigo to the broader market. Our vision is to create an immersive experience for players, blending community engagement, AR technology, and gamified exploration.

We believe in the potential of Iseekaigo to go beyond the hackathon stage and deliver real value to users and stakeholders alike.
